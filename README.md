# Linear Equation solver - Draw Petri Net
## Introduction
This project has to separate module inside it. One module can solve linear equations and the other draws and simulates Petri Net. 
You can solve linear eqautions having any number of variables. If the equations hold a unique solution, linear equation can calculate the answer. The linear equation solving part uses the Gaussian Elimination method for solving the equations. Additionally, you can also draw petri net having states, transitions and create edge between them.
